# Syndication Feeds

This extension for Chrome will try to find any feeds syndicating the current web site, and present them in a pop up. It functions similary to Google's RSS extension, but it does not integrate with any feed readers, or offer a way to subscribe to the feeds it finds. It simply presents the feeds and will open them in a new tab if selected. Other extensions are expected to handle things like: displaying the XML, subscriptions, and parsing feed items.
